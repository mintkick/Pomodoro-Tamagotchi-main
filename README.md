## Software Description

Web application that incentivizes productivity through interacting with a virtual pet. Users have access to a pomodoro timer to track work sessions. Each completed session or set grants food points. These can be given to the pet to keep it from getting hungry. Playing with the pet makes it happy, but makes it hungry.
Along with the timer and pet, there is a task list for the user to create, edit, and delete their own personal objectives. Tasks can optionally be assigned due dates.

## Architecture

JavaScript-based, HTML & CSS for the website

- Frame work: Web Apps: React Front End (JavaScript) and Node JS Back End (JavaScript API server)
- Data Storage: MongoDB

## Reflections

Our goal with Canvas integration proved to be too complicated at first, so we decided to simplify the scope to get a product out sooner. Another issue with the API involved conflict of rights to exporting data from Canvas into third-party storage.

Involvement and teamwork was key to getting any feature to run properly. During times when our communication and meetings were limited, it was confusing to work with files made by someone else.

Our initial brainstorming ideas for the pet and game aspects were very ambitious. Certainly it inspired the team to work on an impressive product, but we did have to put a lot of features into the stretch goal category.
