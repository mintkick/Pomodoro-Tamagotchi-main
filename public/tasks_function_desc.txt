Section Handling Functions

showSection(section): This function controls the visibility of the "daily" and "tasks" sections based on the provided argument (section).
 It utilizes DOM manipulation to show the selected section and hide the other.

updateTab(section): This function updates the visual styling of the "daily tasks" and "scheduled tasks" tabs based on the active section.
 It adds a "clicked" class to the active tab and removes it from the inactive one.

Daily Task Functions

loadDailyTasks(): This function populates the "daily tasks" list by iterating through the dailyTasks array and creating list
 items (li) for each task. The function also adds a checkbox and the task text content to each list item.

renderDailyTasks(): This function is a refactored version of loadDailyTasks with additional functionalities. 
It clears the existing tasks list, iterates through dailyTasks, creates list items with task text, and adds edit and delete buttons
 for each task.

Scheduled Task Functions

loadTasks(): This function fetches tasks data from an API endpoint (/tasks) using asynchronous functions (async and await). 
It checks for successful responses and parses the JSON data to populate the "scheduled tasks" list. 
It also includes error handling for failed requests.

renderScheduledTasks(): Similar to renderDailyTasks, this function clears the existing tasks list, iterates through tasks, creates list 
items with task text and due date, and adds edit and delete buttons for each task.

Task Modal Functions

openModal(taskType): This function opens the task modal and sets the modal title based on the provided taskType ("daily" or "scheduled"). 
It also controls the visibility of the date input field depending on the task type.

closeModal(): This function simply hides the task modal.

clearModalInputs(): This function clears the text input and date input fields (if applicable) within the task modal.

renderSubmittedTask(index = null): This function handles adding or editing tasks. It checks for a provided index to determine if it's
 an edit or a new task. It validates user input and updates the corresponding task data (dailyTasks or tasks) before calling 
 renderDailyTasks or loadTasks to refresh the lists.

Other Functions

resetDailyTasks(): This function resets the dailyTasks array to an empty list, essentially clearing all daily tasks. 
It then calls loadDailyTasks to reload the empty list.

deleteTask(id) (commented out): This function likely utilizes the Fetch API to send a DELETE request to an API endpoint 
(/tasks/${id}) to delete a specific task. It also includes error handling.

updateTask(id, updatedData) (commented out): Similar to deleteTask, this function sends a PUT request with updated task data (updatedData)
 to the API endpoint (/tasks/${id}) to update an existing task. Error handling is also included.

submitTask(task): This function uses the Fetch API to send a POST request with the new task data (task) to the API endpoint (/tasks) 
to create a new task. It then updates the UI by adding the new task to the list and closes the modal.

Event Listeners (commented out)

The commented-out section contains event listeners for various functionalities like handling clicks on task tabs, adding daily and scheduled
 tasks, editing tasks, and deleting tasks on screen. These functionalities are likely implemented elsewhere in the code.

Overall, this code snippet manages daily and scheduled tasks with UI manipulation, interacts with an API for data retrieval and 
manipulation, and provides functionalities for adding, editing, and deleting tasks.
