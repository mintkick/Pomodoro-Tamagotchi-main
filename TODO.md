# Things to do

## Recommendations

 1. Starting fresh on the tasks.js file (comment everything out, put it in a new file)
 2. Putting everything inside of functions and separate the business logic from the view logic
     - createModal()
     - closeModal()
     
     // The busines logic
     - createTask()
     - deleteTask()
     - updateTask()
     - listTasks()
     


## Creating tasks
Get the user cookie for userId
add that to the task that you are about to save to the database, so we can look it up later

make alterations to work with daily tasks and scheduled tasks
mark tasks completed
